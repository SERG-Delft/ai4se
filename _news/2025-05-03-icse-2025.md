From April 27–May 3 2025, the 47th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2025) took place in Ottawa, Canada. AI4SE researchers from JetBrains and TU Delft were on the program across the Research Track and workshop.

**Joint JetBrains / TU Delft highlights included:**

* Research Track (full paper) — [Metamorphic‑Based Many‑Objective Distillation of LLMs for Code‑related Tasks](https://arc.net/l/quote/nvrstiya) — Annibale Panichella. [Programme link](https://arc.net/l/quote/ilxcjlxr)

* IDE Workshop @ ICSE (IDE 2025) — [Rethinking IDE Customization for Enhanced HAX: A Hyperdimensional Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02491) — Roham Koohestani, Maliheh Izadi. [Programme link](https://arc.net/l/quote/zgwalxgq)

It was a packed and inspiring week for our software-engineering and AI research — congratulations to all presenters and collaborators for showcasing AI4SE’s work on the ICSE stage and contributing to the conference’s 50-year legacy!
