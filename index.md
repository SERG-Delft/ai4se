# AI for Software Engineering

The emergence of advanced AI-driven tools has led to a wide range of opportunities and transformations in software engineering practices and education. Recognizing this potential, [JetBrains] and [Delft University of Technology][tudelft] have collaborated to establish the **AI for Software Engineering (AI4SE)** research partnership. Together, we are committed to conducting cutting-edge research on the impact and utilization of AI methodologies in software engineering. Our focus areas include diverse facets of the domain, such as software development, testing, and programming education.

_The core of AI4SE consists of five [research tracks](tracks) 
in which researchers and five PhD students (one for each track) work together on a range of relevant topics.
The research partnership is run by a joint team of researchers at JetBrains and TU Delft, including 
[Arie van Deursen][avandeursen] and [Maliheh Izadi][maliheh] from TU Delft,
as well as [Vladimir Kovalenko][vladimir] and [Pouria Derakhshanfar][pouria] from JetBrains._

Software Testing Research, Code Modeling, HAX, Dynamic Program Analysis, Education Research teams from JetBrains Research are involved in AI4SE.
From TU Delft's side, [AISE][aise] and [CISE](https://www.ciselab.nl/) research labs from the [Software Engineering Research Group][serg] and the [Center of Education and Learning](https://www.educationandlearning.nl/home) are involved.
We are open to collaborations!

AI4SE was launched in 2023 and participates in the Innovation Center for Artificial Intelligence ([ICAI][icai]) as one of its labs.
